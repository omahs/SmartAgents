# Values To Imbue In Our Smart Agents & For Dev Contributions To Be Ranked By
- Open Source: The software code underpinning the Smart Agents must be freely reviewable, editable & copyable by all.
- Peer to Peer: A system which allows for direct connection by all and is free of centralized intermediaries in all their functions.
- Public Blockchain: A distributed public immutable ledger / system of record for interactions of the Smart Agent. This can be used as proof that a Smart Agent is following its own rules and offers a high level of transparency in the system.
- Tokenized Ownership: Setting forth the means of rewarding participants & stakeholders contributing to Smart Agents.
- Permissionless: No one should be required to ask an authority to access their Smart Agent.
- Freedom of Access: No one should have their use of the Smart Agent blocked or otherwise censored.
- Privacy Preserving: No one should have to expose their private information to use their Smart Agent.
- Freedom of Exit: Acts taken by the Smart Agent should have a means of a defined exit from participation.
- Self Sovereign Identity: All users have the power to generate their own identities and their consent is required to use those credentials.
- Freedom of Association: All those using Smart Agents maintain their independence and freedom of association. 

Scoring each blockchain, Dapp, DAO, & Smart Contract against the list of values above will generate a **"Dapps Score"**. Via the Dapps Score these values will go into the calculation of how to weight the Smart Contracts as part of PromptRank and thus lower the visibility of high risk or centralized options in favor of open source decentralized options.

## Quantifying The Values

- Open Source: Point awarded if GPL, APACHE, MIT, Unlicense or other open source license is used on primary repo. Easy to quantify. 
- Peer to Peer: Point awarded if primary functions are executed locally or via a Peer to Peer network. Easy to quantify.
- Public Blockchain: Point awarded if primary functions are executed locally or via a public blockchain with greater than 100 validators. Quantifiable.
- Tokenized Ownership: Point awarded if a majority community owned token powers its primary functions or ownership is user's private key based. Easst to quantify.
- Permissionless: Point awarded if the primary functions can be executed by anyone without an intermediary. Easy to quantify.
- Freedom of Access: Point awarded if documentation and website are public. Easy to quantify.
- Privacy Preserving: Point awarded if zero knowledge, mimble wimble, bullet proofs or other privacy methods are used to protect user data. Quantifiable.
- Freedom of Exit: Point awarded if there are no penalties for leaving the project. Harder to quantify as it involves tokenomics.
- Self Sovereign Identity: Point awarded if Web3 wallets supporting self custody can interact with the project. Easy to quantify.
- Freedom of Association: Point awarded if users can openly interact with other users without an intermediary.
